# Clojure Developer at Fluent (Remote)

We care about what you love to do, and how you love to do it. 

## What we're doing: Co-creation and the graph

Here at Fluent we're building a new kind of online collaboration (or co-creation) tool, where data is malleable and interconnected, and can be presented in ways that are tailor-made for different use cases. It's kind of like Roam + Basecamp + Airtable + Notion, with a global graph database as a foundation. 

Here's a video that has inspired our vision, where our friend Wilker explains his concept of [The Maximal Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS3i3DTUnAI).

On a technical level our stack is pretty much 100% Clojure(Script), based on [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com), and deployed to AWS.

## Position

Though we're based in Stockholm, we're a 100% remote-first company and don't really care where you live as long as we can work well together.

The position offers a competitive salary and equity opportunity, along with the chance to have a big impact and lots of influence by joining the core team early in our journey.

## Is this you?

- Do you thrive on learning new domains and diving in to tough technical challenges?
- Are you interested in functional programming, cloud technologies, digging deeply into data-intensive architectures?
- When you write code and think about product, do you do it with the end user in mind?
- Are you able to take on a problem, dive deep, asking questions when needed, but take full ownership of the process?
- Do you have a rich life outside work, and are you generally a curious and positive force?

If so, we'd love to talk. We are always looking for full-time team members, both junior and senior. Email us at:

PS. Currently, our focus is primarily on **Senior Clojure Developers** with many years of professional experience, working on cloud-based user-facing systems at scale. If you have worked remotely before, and liked it, that's a plus.
